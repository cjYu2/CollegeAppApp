Application Name:
College App ^2

Short Description:
College Applications are a grueling process. As Seniors we have experienced the difficult path of adhering to deadlines, 
presenting ourselves in small essays, and selecting colleges. Our app will help future college applicants manage their time, 
avoid procrastination, choose colleges that would result in a good fit, and upload supplemental information in order to present 
a more wholesome image.

Problem Statement:
As a student applying for college, sometimes the process can be daunting since there is so much 
information needed to complete the applications which cannot be found in one unified place. 
Furthermore, it would be helpful for students to know how they’re doing in terms of progress. 
Students also don’t know the average GPA or SAT/ACT score that the school requires as that 
information is not as accessible. Not to mention, students have to do additional research to find 
out what application each school uses (ex: Common Application or Coalition) and it could be 
confusing on whether a letter of recommendation is required, optional, or not accepted. 
As per user reviews we plan on adding financial aid information for the Fafsa and CSS 
profile furthermore, we plan on adding additional functionality for tracking scholarship essays/requirements.

Class Design (description, UML, and Unit Tests):
The classes we used have very specific functions for our application. For example the Username 
and Password classes have personalized data stored for the user and check if the input data matches with the user’s information.
The getters and setters we used for example the getFirstname and setLastname serve to allow the user to input their information and 
see it display on the app, thus making the app more personalized. We used getters for our Deadlines information which is crucial to 
the functionalities of our app: getDate. Overall, the classes we used were very much applied to the particular functions of the 
application we designed. The Unit tests we implemented have direct correlations with the different classes we implemented. For example, we used CheckLastname to ensure that the code worked as we intended in displaying and delegating the correct information. Furthermore, we utilized similar unit tests such as CheckDate as well as CheckFirstname, in order to test that the program progressed through the appropriate portions of code and functioned as intended. Additional similar unit tests were implemented into our code for keeping our code working at the highest level.

Unique Feature of Application:
The unique feature of our application is the ability to upload supplemental documents. By sending this information to colleges, the universities will gain a more comprehensive understanding of the student and as a result increase the chances of the student being admitted. Art students can submit their artwork and designs, medical students can submit their medical professional papers, aspiring leaders and innovators can submit research results. Overall this functionality allows for students to express themselves and present the most attractive aspects of themselves in order to be admitted into the college they deserve.

Project Summary:
CJ Yu was the head coder for the project, he had the brunt of the responsibility when it came to ensuring that the code functioned to the highest degree. He worked diligently and efficiently through making the various functions of the code work correctly. The fellow members also assisted whenever possible in adding functionalities integral to the application's success. Pranav Amuthasenthil was the head architect for the project, he played heavy roles in the planning and designing of the project, documenting the project, finishing the project presentation, and acted as an overseer in ensuring that the team stayed on task and worked efficiently towards the deadline. Nikhil Ramesh worked heavily in the coding aspects of the project as well, but also played substantial roles in Proto.io and integrating the different functions of the code together and ensuring that the code worked seamlessly. Noor Haider worked throughout every aspect of the project, he worked cooperatively with CJ in coding the several functionalities the app required, he and Pranav worked extensively with one another in designing the application's user interface, and worked with Nikhil in making the prototype for the app in Proto.io. The design process came quite naturally, all the group’s members are Seniors who have finished their college applications and thus when designing the app, we just implemented what we felt would have helped us in the process. We faced several challenges in finishing the code in a timely manner and implementing as much of our selected functionalities as possible. However we did learn much about time management and that there is always a simple method to find a solution, as well as that asking for input from other teams can be quite helpful even if the problems are not related to the other teams. In the future we plan on working together on the code as more of a unit instead of doing it separately and making it work together smoothly in the end.
