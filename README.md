Application Name:
College App ^2

Short Description:
College Applications are a grueling process. As Seniors we have experienced the difficult path of adhering to deadlines, 
presenting ourselves in small essays, and selecting colleges. Our app will help future college applicants manage their time, 
avoid procrastination, choose colleges that would result in a good fit, and upload supplemental information in order to present 
a more wholesome image.

Problem Statement:
As a student applying for college, sometimes the process can be daunting since there is so much 
information needed to complete the applications which cannot be found in one unified place. 
Furthermore, it would be helpful for students to know how they’re doing in terms of progress. 
Students also don’t know the average GPA or SAT/ACT score that the school requires as that 
information is not as accessible. Not to mention, students have to do additional research to find 
out what application each school uses (ex: Common Application or Coalition) and it could be 
confusing on whether a letter of recommendation is required, optional, or not accepted. 
As per user reviews we plan on adding financial aid information for the Fafsa and CSS 
profile furthermore, we plan on adding additional functionality for tracking scholarship essays/requirements.

Class Design (description, UML, and Unit Tests):
The classes we used have very specific functions for our application. For example the Username 
and Password classes have personalized data stored for the user and check if the input data matches with the user’s information.
The getters and setters we used for example the getFirstname and setLastname serve to allow the user to input their information and 
see it display on the app, thus making the app more personalized. We used getters for our Deadlines information which is crucial to 
the functionalities of our app: getDate. Overall, the classes we used were very much applied to the particular functions of the 
application we designed.
